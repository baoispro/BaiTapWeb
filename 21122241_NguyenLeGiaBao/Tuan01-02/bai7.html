    A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it
    takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an
    action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
